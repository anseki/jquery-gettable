And it gets cells that is positioned on those lines. The handling cells that is positioned on horizontal line is supported by `<tr>` HTML tag, but vertical line is not supported by HTML.\r\n+ The cells that is extended by `colspan`/`rowspan` are parsed correctly. More lines pass through the extended cells (i.e. those cells catch more cells), and those cells are positioned on more lines (i.e. those cells are caught by more cells).\r\n+ The horizontal line (`row`) and vertical line (`col`) are discerned. getTable returns a jQuery object (or Array of those), therefore you can do anything you want to those.\r\n+ The table is parsed via DOM, it's fast, correctly, and those data are cached. \r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Get rows that include target cell.\r\nrows = $('td#target').getTable('rows');\r\n\r\n// Get cols that include target cell.\r\ncols = $('td#target').getTable('cols');\r\n\r\n// Get cells that is included in cross line (rows and cols) of target cell, and style those.\r\ncells = $('td#target').getTable('xCells').css('backgroundColor', 'blue');\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\nLoad after jQuery.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script src=\"jquery-1.11.0.min.js\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"jquery.gettable.min.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Methods\r\n\r\n### `rows`\r\n\r\n```js\r\nrows = target.getTable('rows')\r\n```\r\n\r\nReturn an Array that includes zero or more `row`s. The `row` is a jQuery object that includes zero or more `cell` (`<td>` or `<th>`) elements that is positioned on a horizontal line. The elements are selected according to the each elements that is included in current target jQuery object. The returned `rows` is one Array that includes all of those.\r\n\r\nAn element that is included in current target jQuery object is:\r\n\r\n+ **`table`** (`<table>` element)  \r\nAll `row`s in this `table` are selected.\r\n+ **`row`** (`<tr>` element)  \r\nThis `row` itself is selected.  \r\nThe `cell` elements in this `row` are not the same as `cell` elements in `<tr>` element, which includes `cell`s that is extended by `rowspan` in previous `<tr>`.\r\n+ **`cell`** (`<td>` or `<th>` element)  \r\nAll `row`s that include this `cell` (i.e. horizontal lines that pass through this `cell`) are selected.  \r\n*(If you want both `rows` and `cols` of `cell`, use `xCells` method.)*  \r\nExample:  \r\n```js\r\nvar hl; // keep to restore\r\n$('td').hover(function() {\r\n  hl = $(this).getTable('rows').addClass('highlight');\r\n}, function() {\r\n  hl.removeClass('highlight');\r\n});\r\n```\r\n+ **`section`** (`<thead>`, `<tfoot>` or `<tbody>` element)  \r\nAll `row`s in this `section` are selected.\r\n\r\nIn any cases, the nested `table` (`table` that is included in current target) is excluded (If part of the nested `table` is target too, of course it is included).\r\n\r\n### `cols`\r\n\r\n```js\r\ncols = target.getTable('cols')\r\n```\r\n\r\nReturn an Array that includes zero or more `col`s. The `col` is a jQuery object that includes zero or more `cell` (`<td>` or `<th>`) elements that is positioned on a vertical line. The elements are selected according to the each elements that is included in current target jQuery object. The returned `cols` is one Array that includes all of those.\r\n\r\nAn element that is included in current target jQuery object is:\r\n\r\n+ **`table`, `row`, `section`** (`<table>`, `<tr>`, `<thead>`, `<tfoot>` or `<tbody>` element)  \r\nAll `col`s in this `table` are selected.\r\n+ **`cell`** (`<td>` or `<th>` element)  \r\nAll `col`s that include this `cell` (i.e. vertical lines that pass through this `cell`) are selected.  \r\n*(If you want both `rows` and `cols` of `cell`, use `xCells` method.)*  \r\nExample:  \r\n```js\r\nvar hl; // keep to restore\r\n$('td').hover(function() {\r\n  hl = $(this).getTable('cols').addClass('highlight');\r\n}, function() {\r\n  hl.removeClass('highlight');\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn any cases, the nested `table` (`table` that is included in current target) is excluded (If part of the nested `table` is target too, of course it is included).\r\n\r\n### `cells`\r\n\r\n```js\r\ncells = target.getTable('cells')\r\n```\r\n\r\nReturn a jQuery object that includes zero or more `cell` (`<td>` or `<th>`) elements. The elements are selected according to the each elements that is included in current target jQuery object. The returned `cells` is one jQuery object that includes all of those.\r\n\r\nAn element that is included in current target jQuery object is:\r\n\r\n+ **`table`** (`<table>` element)  \r\nAll `cell`s in this `table` are selected.\r\n+ **`row`** (`<tr>` element)  \r\nAll `cell`s in this `row` are selected.  \r\nThis is not the same as `cell` elements in `<tr>` element, which includes `cell`s that is extended by `rowspan` in previous `<tr>`.  \r\nExample:  \r\n```js\r\n$('#targetRow').getTable('cells').css('backgroundColor', 'blue');\r\n```\r\n+ **`cell`** (`<td>` or `<th>` element)  \r\nThis `cell` itself is selected.\r\n+ **`section`** (`<thead>`, `<tfoot>` or `<tbody>` element)  \r\nAll `cell`s in this `section` are selected.\r\n\r\nIn any cases, the nested `table` (`table` that is included in current target) is excluded (If part of the nested `table` is target too, of course it is included).\r\n\r\n### `xCells`\r\n\r\n```js\r\ncells = target.getTable('xCells')\r\n```\r\n\r\nReturn a jQuery object that includes zero or more `cell` (`<td>` or `<th>`) elements that is positioned on cross line (horizontal line and vertical line) that pass through the each elements that is included in current target jQuery object. The returned `cells` is one jQuery object that includes all of those.  \r\nThe elements that is not `cell` (`<td>` or `<th>`) are ignored.  \r\n\r\nThis is not the same as merged `cell`s that is returned by `rows` method and `cols` method, `xCells` method returns unique `cell`s, duplicated elements are excluded.\r\n\r\nThe nested `table` (`table` that is included in current target) is excluded (If part of the nested `table` is target too, of course it is included).\r\n\r\nExample:  \r\n```js\r\nvar hl; // keep to restore\r\n$('td').hover(function() {\r\n  hl = $(this).getTable('xCells').addClass('highlight');\r\n}, function() {\r\n  hl.removeClass('highlight');\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### `table`\r\n\r\n```js\r\ntable = target.getTable('table')\r\n```\r\n\r\nReturn a jQuery object that includes zero or more `table` (`<table>`) elements. The `<table>` elements that is included in current target jQuery object, and the `<table>` elements that have `<tr>`, `<td>`, `<th>`, `<thead>`, `<tfoot>` or `<tbody>` elements that is included in current target jQuery object are selected. The returned `table` is one jQuery object that includes all of those (duplicated elements are excluded).  \r\n\r\n## Note\r\n\r\nThe cell extending by `colspan=\"0\"` and `<colgroup>` is not supported. Now, browser that supports this is Firefox only.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
